## Assignment 3

### Weekly Recap

This week I learned how to use boolean, string and work with variables. In my homework for the week, I found out about const which allows me to keep a variable the same throughout the code, jsut applying different commands to it that will expand off of it. I also felt that working with the true and false commands was the easiest type of command to work with in the coding for this week.
