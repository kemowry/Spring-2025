## Weekly 2

### Weekly Recap

My key takeaways for this lesson was exploring more on VS, it was interesting to learn the shortcuts with html and how to copy and paste live links into your document. I also thought that learning about the console commands was very useful, especially for the basics of javascript. This week was challenging due to all the mishaps that happened, however it was very useful to troubleshoot and find out different shortcuts to use when you're stuck.
